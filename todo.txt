Done
====
/ Hashing
/ Internal sockets / remove 'nc' dependency
	/ Better output window situation
/ Change coordinates to tuples
/ Split into modules
/ Proper command queueing / replacement (shift)
/ Syncing / "host" flag
/ Put on Git
/ Attacks
/ Dynamic map nonsense
	/ Update README
/ Commit maps by allowing non-gzipped saves (magic number 0x1f8b)
/ Directional and handed-ness biases per team
/ More sprite states to indicate "fight charged", "move charged", etc
/ Attack windup greater after attack
/ Tab to show seats + allow team changing
/ Only seats with an living team need to ready
/ mini "teams + readiness" indicator, to replace "/team" and console spam
	/ Update README accordingly
/ improved pathing
	/ Pick direction more intelligently when there's bias to be had
	/ When blocked, use tile watchers to resume when there's a path
		! Disputed spaces will still abort pathing if there's no other options
/ More unit types: swordsman / archer / berserker / troll
/ Larger, scrollable map

Important
=========
- Swords have extra health?
- More command options
	Biggest concern here is with how to manage the unexpected over the next turn.
	At the moment, queueing commands is actually not a priority.
	So, a primary command can be "move here" or "kill this".
		This can be issued in "exclusive mode", where it won't auto-attack in the process.
			Exclusive move commands don't expire, so you can get something to stand still and do nothing.
	Additional targets can be marked as well
		In normal mode, these get priority if multiple things enter range at once
		In exclusive mode, these are the only things that will be auto-attacked.
		Maybe you can "additional target" a space to defend it?
	Better command indication - shade all target move cells / attack cells appropriately
- Capture / summon system
	For now, this will probably consist of "keeps" and "farms", both of which are unwalkable.
	"Move into" a keep or farm to capture it, consuming the unit (Cheap swordsman ideal here)
	Farms give points to the controlling team; one "point" per complete turn held, but track it granularly
	Keeps allow summoning units adjacent to them, for cost (and with cooldown)
- Use new centralized redraw() as a way to suspend drawing while in fast-forward
- Board size should be configurable, or better yet dynamic.
- As board size increases, it would be nice to render only part of it.
- More intuitive alliance controls
	Pull affected team from who issued the command
	Something in the tab overlay might be nice
	At the very least, remove the need for bitwise-math in your head
- Alliances must be mutual?
	If this is done, breaking an alliance should un-ready at least the involved parties
- Visual indicator for edit mode
- Exploders have standby mode?

Not Important
=============
- Should allow limited input (e.g. queue up netcommands, send chats...) while running a step
