- Hashing
/ Internal sockets / remove 'nc' dependency
	/ Better output window situation
- improved pathing
	- Pick direction more intelligently when there's bias to be had
	- When blocked, use listeners to resume when there's a path
		Including when multiple clear at once I suppose
- Attack
	- Death "animation"
	Attack should have a slight wind-up so there's an advantage to holding a space
	- Listeners to neighboring spaces
- Syncing / "host" flag
- Proper command queueing / replacement (shift)
- Split into modules
- Better command indication - shade all target cells, circle selected target cell
- Put on Git
